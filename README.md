The task we dealt with and that we brought to completion concerned a classification problem. There was a given set of classified images and our goal was to train an ANN capable of predicting the category the input image belonged to.

The provided dataset (from [Lazebnik et al., 2006]), contains the following 15 categories: 

Office, Kitchen, Living room, Bedroom, Store, Industrial, Tall building, Inside city, Street, Highway, Coast, Open country, Mountain, Forest, Suburb.
